    "# Practical 4: Biomineral Geochemistry\n",
    "\n",
    "A *lot* of effort has been put into measuring the geochemistry of (carbonate) biominerals for use as a palaeoclimate archive. All of these 'proxies' have some underlying physical basis (e.g. the endothermic substitution of Mg for Ca happens at higher temperatures). However, whenever someone measures the geochemistry of a biomineral, it looks different to an inorganic mineral. These differences are known as 'vital effects', which is a bucket-term that encapsulates all the ways that biology can change the geochemistry of a mineral.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical, we're going to think about two key processes that might contribute to the 'vital effect' and their influence on geochemical tracers: Rayleigh Fractionation and Precipitation Rate Controls. We'll then think about how we might be able to combine our understanding of these processes with measurements of biomineral geochemistry to learn about the processes of biomineralisation.\n",

    "\n",
    "The majority of minerals that form in aqueous environments at Earth surface conditions do not form via equilibrium processes. Kinetic factors are a major determinant of the composition of a mineral, and the relative importance of kinetic factors are a strong function of the **precipitation rate** of the mineral.\n",
    "\n",
    "To consider these effects, we need to think about what 'precipitation' means from a kinetic perspective. Even at 'equilibrium' conditions no atom in a structure is completely static. Every atom in a structure has a finite probability of moving to a new site, or leaving the structure into another phase. Each of these 'movements' has an associated energy barrier, and the probability of the movement happening is a function of the energy barrier and free energy available in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For systems like CaCO3 in aqueous environments, this means that there is a constant flux of ions attaching and detaching from the crystal surface. A crystal is in equilibrium (neither growing nor shrinking) when the forward rate ($R_f$) of ion attachment matches the backward rate ($R_b$) of ion detachment. From this, we can define the **precipitation rate** as the difference between the forward and backward rates:\n",

    "In this case, whenever a Ca attached from the solution, there is a finite probability that a Sr will attach instead. This probability is a function of the relative concentration of Sr and Ca in the solution, and the energy barrier for Sr attachment. Conversely, whenever a Ca detaches from the surface, there is a finite probability that a Sr will detach instead. This probability is a function of the relative concentration of Sr and Ca in the solid, and the energy barrier for Sr detachment. For incompatible impurities (where $K_X$ < 1), the probability of detachment is higher than the probability of attachment, leading to a low equilibrium partition coefficient.\n",
