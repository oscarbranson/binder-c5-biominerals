    "# Practical 4: CaCO<sub>3</sub> production and ocean carbon.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical, we'll look at how the evolution of carbonate biomineralisation transformed Earth's carbon cycle.\n",
    "A more in-depth description of the model considered here is outlined in [Zeebe and Westbroek (2003)](http://www.doi.org/10.1029/2003GC000538) - it's an excellent paper, and worth a read.\n",
    "\n",
    "The interaction between carbon and calcifiers in the ocean plays a vital role in Earth's carbon cycle over Kyr time scales.\n",
    "This has not always been the case.\n",
    "The evolution of the ocean carbonate cycle can be split into three key stages:\n",
    "- **Pre-Cambrian**: Ocean carbon is dominated by inorganic process, with carbonate precipitation occurring spontaneously when weathering fluxes drive the ocean to supersaturations that exceed the inhibiting effect of cationic impurities in the ocean. Devoid of life, this is known as the *Strangelove Ocean*.\n",
    "- **Paleozoic**: Following the Cambrian Explosion there is abundant life in shallow marine environments, driving substantial biologically-mediated carbonate formation. The production of biologically mediated carbonates allowed excess saturation to be efficiently precipitated, driving a tight coupling between weathering and removal fluxes. The neritic environments where carbonate deposition dominates lends this phase its name - the *Neritian Ocean*.\n",
    "- **Mesozoic**: The onset of the Mesozoic ushered in the planktic calcifiers, shifting calcium carbonate production into the deep ocean. The presence of a significant deep-ocean carbonate store established the CCD feedback cycle, stabilising the marine carbon cycle. This period is named the *Cretian Ocean* for the extensive chalk beds formed in the period (*Creta* is Latin for chalk).\n",
    "\n",
    "The catalyst for the transitions between these states was the evolution and proliferation of carbonate biomineralisation.\n",
    "This can be conceptualised in a simple steady-state model of deep-ocean CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> concentration, which is determined by the balance between input/ouput fluxes driven by biomineralisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the ocean as a box. The shallowest part of the ocean floor is at a depth of 1 km, which slopes away to a maximum of 6.5 km such that the change in ocean floor area increases linearly with depth. \n",
    "Continental weathering ($F_{in}$) adds $\\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ and $\\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}$ to the ocean surface, and is removed by the formation and deposition of $\\mathrm{CaCO_3}$.\n",
    "Calcification either happens in shallow neritic environments, or in the surface of the whole ocean. Carbonate formed in the surface ocean sinks towards the ocean floor where it accumulates above the lysocline and dissolves below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"figs/model_schematic.png\" style=\"width:30%; min-width:400px;\"></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this model, we'll assume that [Ca] is constant in the ocean, which makes carbonate saturation state depend solely on $\\mathrm{[CO_3^{2-}]}$, which we will denote $c$.\n",
    "Our model assumes steady-state, such that:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\delta c}{\\delta t} = 0 = F_{in} - F_{out}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Where $t$ is time, $F_{in}$ is the input of $c$ from weathering, and $F_{out}$ is the output of $c$ associated with carbonate precipitation.\n",
    "In practice, this just means that the sum outputs from the system must, by definition, always match the inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another key factor we must consider is the influence of depth on the solubulity product of carbonate minerals:\n",
